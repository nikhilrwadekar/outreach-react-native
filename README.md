## Project Description
Outreach is a post-disaster management app for the effective use and management of unaffiliated volunteers. Volunteers, especially disaster volunteers, face challenges like being unable to give as much as they wanted during these calamities. This is where Outreach gets into action of managing volunteers according to their preferences, availability, and location.
